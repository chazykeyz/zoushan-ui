            Who is my biggest inspiration? My mother. I was born and raised in
            Tanzania. A place where nature inspires beauty. At a young age, I
            would sit and watch my mother apply all-natural products to her skin
            after coming out of the bath. I could not help noticing how these
            products helped to keep her skin healthy and rejuvenated. Her skin
            would glow all day long. She would always say, "organic beauty is
            the best". <br />
            <br /> In 2016, I lost my mother. I quickly realized that I had
            fallen in love with organic skincare. Each time I applied her
            products to my skin, I felt directly connected to her. Those times
            became light-bulb moments. What if I could use those same
            ingredients to create an accessible skin line that would also give
            back to my local community? ZOUSHAN was born. Since then, my biggest
            dream has been to create a product line that is all-natural and
            loved by all. <br />
            <br /> ZOUSHAN cosmetics is a 100% handmade skincare solution made
            with love and powered by nature. Organic, ethically sourced, and
            locally made, I am proud to say that I have created a brand that I
            love that serves my community. After testing my products on myself,
            I decided to share the results with the world. I noticed a drastic
            improvement in the texture and tone of my skin and its overall
            health. GIVING BACK.
            <br />
            <br /> Losing my mother gave me a different perspective on
            everything. More so, it shed light for me on the struggles of the
            children in need of a home and parental love. The daily struggles of
            a young child growing without a parent influenced my lifestyle and
            my way of thinking. ZOUSHAN cosmetics is the opportunity for me to
            share the same love and support I received during my time of need.
            With that in mind, I decided that 10% of ZOUSHAN proceeds would be
            distributed to orphanages around the world to fulfill their basic
            need
